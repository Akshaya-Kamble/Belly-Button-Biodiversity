# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Belly Button diversity using Javascrip and Plotly

### Overview of the Project
In this project we have created various types of interactive charts like bar chart,gauge chart and bubble chart. On selecting the volunteer id from the drop down menu the charts reflect data for the respective id and helps the volunteer visualize the data. 


### Result
#### 1. Bar chart
The bar chart shows the top ten otu_ids for the selected id.

#### 2. Gauge chart 
The gauge chart shows the washing frequency per week for the selected id.

#### 3. Bubble chart 
The size of bubbles in the bubble chart also helps us visualize which sample values of a particular bacteria are found highest in the selected id.


### Conclusion
If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel using these interactive charts.
